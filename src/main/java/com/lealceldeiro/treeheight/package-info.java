/**
 * This package contains classes regarding some variations for the following problem:
 *
 * <p> Given the root of a tree, determine the height of the tree. The height of the tree is determined as follow:
 * <p> If there is only one node (the root) the height is zero. If this node has a left and a right children, and those
 * do not have more children, the height is 1 and so on so on for the children of the children. To count +1 in the
 * height counting it is not needed that a node has two children, if the node has only one child node (left or right)
 * the height count +1.
